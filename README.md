# Note

If you wanna build this on local machine you'll need to create a supabase database and create and .env file to connect to it.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The Project is live here : <https://mini-saas-dashboard-snowy.vercel.app/com>

## Database

This uses Supabase as a database, I didnt store anything locally it cat be tested on the live demon linked above.
